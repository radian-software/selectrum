# Selectrum

*Selectrum is a better solution for incremental narrowing in Emacs,
replacing [Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm),
[Ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#ivy), and
[Ido](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ido/index.html)*.

## What is it?

Selectrum provides an interface for selecting items from a list. You
can use it to run a command with `M-x`:

<p align="center"> <img src="images/commands.png" alt="Picking from a
list of commands" height="200"/> </p>

You can use it to open a file with `C-x C-f` (`find-file`):

<p align="center"> <img src="images/files.png" alt="Navigating the
filesystem" height="200"/> </p>

Even [TRAMP](https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/#Quick-Start-Guide)
works great out of the box:

<p align="center"> <img src="images/tramp.png" alt="Using sudo via
TRAMP" height="200"/> </p>

You can switch buffers:

<p align="center"> <img src="images/buffers.png" alt="Switching to
another buffer" height="200"/> </p>

And every other command in Emacs is automatically enhanced, without
the need for any configuration:

libraries, with load-path shadows" height="200"/> </p>

## Installation

Selectrum is [available as a package on
MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/selectrum). The easiest way to install this
package is using
[`straight.el`](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el):

```elisp
(straight-use-package 'selectrum)
```

However, you may install using any other package manager if you
prefer.

## Usage

To enable Selectrum, simply add to your init-file:

```elisp
(selectrum-mode +1)
```

Now all of your favorite Emacs commands will automatically use
Selectrum. However, the default sorting and filtering is very basic.
It is recommended to use
[`prescient.el`](https://github.com/raxod502/prescient.el) to enable
more intelligent sorting and filtering. Simply install the
`selectrum-prescient` package from MELPA and add to your init-file:

```elisp
;; to make sorting and filtering more intelligent
(selectrum-prescient-mode +1)

;; to save your command history on disk, so the sorting gets more
;; intelligent over time
(prescient-persist-mode +1)
```

## User guide

The design philosophy of Selectrum is to be as simple as possible,
because selecting an item from a list really doesn't have to be that
complicated, and you don't have time to learn all the hottest tricks
and keybindings for this. What this means is that Selectrum always
prioritizes consistency, simplicity, and understandability over making
optimal choices for workflow streamlining. The idea is that when
things go wrong, you'll find it easy to understand what happened and
how to fix it.

### Keybindings

* *To navigate to a candidate:* use the standard motion commands
  (`<up>`, `<down>`, `C-v`, `M-v`, `M-<`, `M->`). If you prefer, you
  can use `C-p` and `C-n` instead of the arrow keys.
* *To accept the currently selected candidate:* type `RET`. (With a
  prefix argument, accept instead the candidate at that point in the
  list, counting from one. See `selectrum-show-indices`. The value
  zero means to accept exactly what you've typed, as in the next
  bullet point.) You can also click the left mouse button on a
  candidate to choose it.
* *To submit what you've typed, even if it's not a candidate:* you can
  use `<up>` or `C-p` to select the user input just like a regular
  candidate, and type `RET` as usual. (Alternatively, you can type
  `C-j` to submit your exact input without selecting it first.)
* *To abort:* as per usual, type `C-g`.
* *To navigate into the currently selected directory while finding a
  file\:* type `TAB`. (What this actually does is insert the currently
  selected candidate into the minibuffer, which for `find-file` has
  the effect of navigating into a directory.) With a positive prefix
  argument, insert the candidate at that point in the list, counting
  from one. See `selectrum-show-indices`. A non-positive prefix
  argument inserts the candidate corresponding to
  `selectrum--current-candidate-index`. You can also right click on a
  candidate to insert it into the minibuffer.
* *To copy the current candidate:* type `M-w` or what is bound to
  `kill-ring-save`. When there's an active region in your input, this
  still copies the active region. The behavior of `M-w` is not
  modified when Transient Mark mode is disabled.
* *To select multiple candidates:* separate them with `crm-separator`
  (`,` by default). To make this workflow more convenient, you can use
  `TAB` to complete the currently selected candidate before typing `,`
  to move on to entering the next one. This feature only works in
  commands that use `completing-read-multiple`, such as
  `describe-face`. (If multiple selection is enabled, it is shown in
  the minibuffer prompt.)

Selectrum respects your custom keybindings, so if you've bound
`next-line` to `M-*` for some reason, then pressing `M-*` will select
the next candidate. If you don't like the standard Selectrum bindings,
you can change them by customizing `selectrum-minibuffer-bindings`,
and your changes will take effect right away.

The keybindings listed above are the *only* ones changed from standard
editing bindings. So, for example:

* All your standard horizontal motion, selection, insertion, and
  deletion commands work as usual.
* To delete your current input, just use `C-a C-k` or `C-S-backspace`
  (bound to `kill-whole-line`).
* To edit by word units use `M-DEL` like usual. To go up a directory
  you can use `C-M-DEL` (bound to `backward-kill-sexp`). Be aware that
  on some Linux distributions, this binding is used to kill the X
  server, which can cause loss of unsaved work. In that case, you can
  also use Emacs default binding `ESC C-DEL`.
* To navigate to your home directory, you can just use `C-a C-k ~/`.
* Minibuffer history navigation works as usual with `M-p` and `M-n`.
  `M-r` will invoke an improved version of history search with
  completion.

### Sorting and filtering

The default sorting and filtering in Selectrum is quite primitive.
First candidates are sorted alphabetically, and then they are filtered
down to those that contain your input as a substring. The part of each
candidate that matches your input is highlighted. This default
behavior is intended as a lowest common denominator that will
definitely work.

However, it is strongly recommended that you set up
[`prescient.el`](https://github.com/raxod502/prescient.el) in order to
get more intelligent sorting and filtering. (See the "getting started"
section for how to do this.) With `prescient.el`:

* Your most recent choices are saved, and those are sorted first.
  After that, your most frequent choices are saved, and those are
  sorted next. The rest of the candidates are sorted by length. This
  algorithm turns out to do very well in practice while being fast and
  not very magical.
* Your input is split on spaces into subqueries, each of which must
  match as either a substring, a regexp, or an initialism (e.g. `ffap`
  matches `find-file-at-point`) in order for a candidate to be
  included. Again, this algorithm isn't optimal, but it does very well
  in practice given its simplicity and speed.
* The part of each candidate that matched your input is highlighted,
  with the initials of an initialism highlighted in a second color.

It is possible to supply your own sorting, filtering, and highlighting
logic if you would like. For that, see the developer guide later in
this documentation.

Selectrum adds two special features on top of whatever sorting and
filtering is selected:

* If your input matches one of the candidates exactly, then that
  candidate is unconditionally sorted first. (So, if you type in
  `find-file`, then `ido-find-file` will never be sorted before
  `find-file`, no matter what.) This is intended to reduce frustration
  in the case that you know what you want and you don't want Selectrum
  getting in the way.
* After that, if the caller of Selectrum specified a default candidate
  (for example, `describe-function` suggests the function near point
  as a default) then that candidate will be sorted before the rest.
  This means you can just press `RET` immediately to accept the
  default, like usual.

Selectrum doesn't have any special handling of case-sensitivity,
because Emacs includes a system for this by default. The command `M-x
toggle-case-fold-search` toggles globally between case-sensitive
matching and case-insensitive matching.

### Additional features

* You can repeat the last command that invoked Selectrum, restoring
  your user input and selected candidate, using `selectrum-repeat`.
  You must bind this command to a key sequence in order to use it,
  since running `selectrum-repeat` from `M-x` will dutifully repeat
  the last command that invoked Selectrum, which was `M-x`. For
  example:

  ```elisp
  (global-set-key "C-x C-z" #'selectrum-repeat)
  ```

* There is experimental support for running Helm commands via the
  Selectrum interface. The idea is that we install some advices on
  Helm which translate calls to the Helm API into calls to the
  Selectrum API. Needless to say, this translation comes at a loss of
  functionality, since Helm is a behemoth which supports every
  conceivable kind of completion paradigm while Selectrum is designed
  to have as few features as possible without seriously compromising
  user experience. However, this support might allow you to make more
  convenient use of the extensive Helm ecosystem.

  To use the support, enable `selectrum-helm-mode` from the
  `selectrum-helm` library.

### Customization

* By default, ten candidates are shown in the minibuffer at any given
  time. You can customize that by changing
  `selectrum-num-candidates-displayed`.
    * Normally `selectrum-num-candidates-displayed` acts as just a
      maximum for the height of the minibuffer. You might prefer for
      the minibuffer to *always* have that height, even if there are
      fewer candidates. This behavior may be achieved by setting
      `selectrum-fix-minibuffer-height` to a non-nil value.
* The currently selected candidate is highlighted with the face
  `selectrum-current-candidate`. If you don't like the color, you can
  adjust it to taste.
* By default, the part of each candidate that matches your input is
  highlighted with the face `selectrum-primary-highlight`. There is
  also `selectrum-secondary-highlight`, which is not used by default
  but is provided for other packages that may use more complex
  highlighting schemes (such as `prescient.el`).
* By default, the total number of matches are shown before the prompt.
  This behavior can be customized using `selectrum-count-style`.
* You can cause the candidates to be numbered sequentially in the
  minibuffer by enabling `selectrum-show-indices`. This may be helpful
  in telling you what prefix argument you should pass to
  `selectrum-select-current-candidate` in order to select a given
  candidate.
* The `selectrum-completion-in-region` function can display
  annotations if the `completion-in-region-function` backend offers
  them. Customize the face `selectrum-completion-annotation` to change
  their appearance.
    * Customize the face `selectrum-completion-docsig` to change the
      appearance of function signatures show by
      `completion-in-region`.
    * Customize the face `completions-common-part` to change the
      appearance of the common prefix in `completion-in-region`
      candidates.

As an example of customizing the faces, I use the
[Zerodark](https://github.com/NicolasPetton/zerodark-theme) color
theme, which includes colors for Ivy, but not for Selectrum. I
inspected the theme source code to see what colors were being used for
Ivy, and copied them to be used for Selectrum as well:

```elisp
(require 'zerodark-theme)

(let ((class '((class color) (min-colors 89))))
  (custom-theme-set-faces
   'zerodark
   `(selectrum-current-candidate
     ((,class (:background "#48384c"
                           :weight bold
                           :foreground "#c678dd"))))
   `(selectrum-primary-highlight ((,class (:foreground "#da8548"))))
   `(selectrum-secondary-highlight ((,class (:foreground "#98be65"))))))

(enable-theme 'zerodark)
```

### Complementary extensions

Selectrum has a
[wiki](https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum/wiki/Useful-Commands), on
which people have contributed handy commands for doing things like
finding buffers and recent files at the same time. It is rather like
[Counsel](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#counsel). Feel free to add
your own commands! The wiki also contains configuration tips for
external packages
[here](https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum/wiki/Additional-Configuration).

External packages that work well with Selectrum:

* You can display completions in a child frame using
  [emacs-mini-frame](https://github.com/muffinmad/emacs-mini-frame).

* Imenu completion can be improved by using
  [flimenu](https://github.com/IvanMalison/flimenu) which turns the
  tree based item navigation into a flat completion menu.

* As an alternative sorting method to `prescient.el` (although it only
  works for `M-x`), there is
  [Amx](https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/amx). It has some extra
  features specific to `M-x`, like displaying keybindings, ignoring
  uninteresting commands, and performing alternate actions (such as
  `C-h f` instead of `RET` to look up docs for a command instead of
  calling it). It is also reported that Amx may be faster than
  `prescient.el` because it uses a different sorting algorithm.

* As an alternative filtering method to `prescient.el`, there is
  [orderless](https://github.com/oantolin/orderless). It supports many
  different matching styles and integrates with `completion-styles`.

### But what is it doing to my Emacs??

By inspecting the source code of `selectrum-mode`, you will see that
Selectrum operates by setting a number of standard Emacs variables
(`completing-read-function`, `read-file-name-function`, etc.) and
installing advice on a number of standard functions
(`read-library-name`, `minibuffer-message`, etc.).

If you object to these changes being made magically, you can make them
yourself and refrain from enabling `selectrum-mode`. However,
backwards compatibility is not guaranteed for this usage, so you will
need to review the source code of `selectrum-mode` after each update
of Selectrum.

The autoloads of Selectrum are set up so that you can enable
`selectrum-mode` without actually loading Selectrum. It will only be
loaded once you use some of its functionality in an interactive
command.

## Developer guide

This section is intended for the authors of packages which integrate
with Selectrum, or for end users who wish to customize the sorting and
filtering behavior of Selectrum.

### Usage of Selectrum

**In normal usage, there should be no need to use any
Selectrum-specific functions. Simply use `completing-read` and
friends, and Selectrum will automatically enhance the experience if
`selectrum-mode` is enabled.**

However, Selectrum does expose some internal functions as part of its
public API. The main entry point is the function `selectrum-read`.
This function is rather like `completing-read`, but with a cleaner
API. See the docstring for details. The various functions and advice
installed by Selectrum just call into `selectrum-read` with various
arguments, after translating whatever Emacs API they implement into
Selectrum's least common denominator.

Unless you are extending Selectrum to support some very weird function
which (ab)uses the `completing-read` framework in an interesting way,
you shouldn't need to use `selectrum-read` directly, as all Emacs
functions should call into it as appropriate when `selectrum-mode` is
enabled.

In addition to `selectrum-read`, Selectrum makes available as part of
its public API some of the functions that wrap `selectrum-read`:

* `selectrum-completing-read` (for `completing-read-function`)
* `selectrum-completing-read-multiple` (to override
  `completing-read-multiple`)
* `selectrum-completion-in-region` (for
  `completion-in-region-function`)
* `selectrum-read-buffer` (for `read-buffer-function`)
* `selectrum-read-file-name` (for `read-file-name-function`)
* `selectrum-read-directory-name` (to override `read-directory-name`)
* `selectrum-read-library-name` (to override `read-library-name`)

You can use these functions in defining variants of Selectrum-based
commands. If you need to do something more complicated than just
calling one of these functions with special options, then define your
own function and call `selectrum-read` directly.

### Sorting, filtering, and highlighting

Selectrum exposes a very simple API for sorting, filtering, and
highlighting. Each of these three tasks is controlled by a separate
user option:

* `selectrum-preprocess-candidates-function` takes the original list
  of candidates and sorts it (actually, it can do any sort of
  preprocessing it wants). Usually preprocessing only happens once.
  However, if a function is passed to `selectrum-read` to generate the
  candidate list dynamically based on the user input, then
  preprocessing happens instead after each input change.
* `selectrum-refine-candidates-function` takes the preprocessed list
  and filters it using the user's input. This refinement happens every
  time the user input is updated.
* `selectrum-highlight-candidates-function` takes a list of the
  refined candidates that are going to be displayed in the minibuffer,
  and propertizes them with highlighting.

For exact specifications of these functions, including whether or not
the input list may be modified, please see their docstrings. This
information is important, because if you make copies of the candidate
list unnecessarily, there will be noticeable lag due to the slowness
of Emacs' garbage collector.

### Text properties

What has been described so far suffices for most cases. However, some
types of candidate selection (in particular, `find-file`) are more
complex. This complexity is minimized by abstracting the essential
requirements of the `find-file` implementation into a simple API.

The API is based primarily on the following three text properties,
which may be applied to candidates using `propertize`:

* `selectrum-candidate-display-prefix`: controls how the candidate is
  displayed in the list shown in the minibuffer. If this property is
  present, then its value is prepended to the candidate when it is
  displayed. This is used, for example, to display disambiguating
  parent directories in `read-library-name`.
* `selectrum-candidate-display-suffix`: same as the display prefix,
  but it's postpended instead of prepended when the candidate is
  dispalyed. This is used, for example, to display candidate
  annotations under `completion-in-region`.
* `selectrum-candidate-full`: controls how the candidate appears in
  the user input area of the minibuffer. If this property is present,
  then it specifies the canonical representation of the candidate.
  This is the value that will be returned from `selectrum-read`. It is
  also the value that will be inserted when the user presses `TAB`. In
  `find-file`, the canonical representation of each candidate is its
  absolute path on the filesystem.

Besides, we have:

* `selectrum-candidate-display-right-margin`: if this property is
  presented, its value is displayed at the right margin after the
  candidate. Currently Selectrum doesn't make use of this property. It
  can be used to display supplementary information in user-defined
  commands.

Note that sorting, filtering, and highlighting is done on the standard
values of candidates, before any of these text properties are handled.

To really understand how these pieces work together, it is best to
inspect the source code of `selectrum-read-buffer` and
`selectrum-read-file-name` (an effort has been made to make the code
readable).

### Hooks

Selectrum provides two hooks for getting information about what
candidates were selected. These are intended primarily for packages
like `prescient.el` which want to record history statistics. The hooks
are:

* `selectrum-candidate-selected-hook`
* `selectrum-candidate-inserted-hook`

For more information, see their docstrings.

## Contributor guide

Please see [the contributor guide for my
projects](https://github.com/raxod502/contributor-guide).

Technical points:

* When adding a new state variable (like for example
  `selectrum--current-candidate-index`), you should think if its value
  needs to be preserved when entering a recursive Selectrum session.
  If so, you should add it to the list in
  `selectrum--save-global-state`.
* By default, `debug-on-error` doesn't work for errors that happen on
  `post-command-hook`. You can work around the issue like so:

  ```elisp
  (defun force-debug (func &rest args)
    (condition-case e
        (apply func args)
      ((debug error) (signal (car e) (cdr e)))))

  (advice-add #'selectrum--minibuffer-post-command-hook :around #'force-debug)
  ```

## Caveats

* There is currently no support for alternate actions, although there
  are plans for how this feature could be implemented without
  descending into the madness of how Ivy and Helm do it.
* In Emacs 25 and earlier, `M-x ffap` is basically completely broken.
  This is because in old versions of Emacs, `ffap` worked by calling
  `completing-read` directly with a special completion table function,
  rather than just using `read-file-name` like would be reasonable.
  Since Emacs 25 is going to die eventually, I'm not going to bother
  fixing this, although pull requests would be accepted.
* In Emacs 26 and earlier, the way that messages are displayed while
  the minibuffer is active is unworkably bad: they block out the
  entire minibuffer as long as they are displayed, and then mess up
  redisplay. This issue has been fixed in Emacs 27, and I suggest
  upgrading. I think the best solution for people running Emacs 26
  would be the development of a small third-party package which
  backports the improvement from Emacs 27. That way all
  minibuffer-based packages can benefit from the improvement.

## Why use Selectrum?

This section documents why I decided to write Selectrum instead of
using any of the numerous existing solutions in Emacs.

I have not used many of these packages extensively. So, if you think
I've overlooked an important part or I've written something mean or
unfair, **please** feel free to contribute a correction.

See [#23](https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum/issues/23) for
discussion.

### Why not Ido?

[Ido](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ido/index.html)
is a package for interactive selection that is included in Emacs by
default. It's a great improvement on the default `completing-read`
experience. However, I don't like how it displays candidates in a
horizontal instead of a vertical manner. It feels less intuitive to
me. Another key issue with Ido is that it hardly supports any commands
out of the box (only buffers and files). There is an extension package
[ido-completing-read+](https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/ido-completing-read-plus)
which adds support for the `completing-read` interface, but I have
been told that even this package does not handle all the cases
correctly.

There is a package
[`ido-vertical-mode`](https://github.com/creichert/ido-vertical-mode.el)
which makes Ido display candidates vertically instead of horizontally,
but I suspect that the problems with `completing-read` non-compliance
remain.

### Why not Helm?

[Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm) is an installable package
which provides an alternate vertical interface for candidate
selection. It has the advantage of having very many features and a
large number of packages which integrate with it. However, the problem
with Helm for me is exactly that it has too many features. Upon
opening a Helm menu, I am immediately confronted by numerous colors,
diagnostics, options, and pieces of help text. It is too complicated
for the problem I want solved.

### Why not Ivy?

[Ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#ivy) is the most promising
alternative to Selectrum, and it's what I used before developing
Selectrum. It is marketed as a minimal alternative to Helm which
provides a simpler interface. The problem with Ivy is that its
architecture and API are very messy, and as a result the
implementation is complex and buggy. Ivy was originally designed to be
used as a backend to
[Swiper](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#swiper), a buffer search
package that originally used Helm. Unfortunately, when Ivy became a
more general-purpose interactive selection package, its abstractions
were not reworked to make sense in this new context. Over time, more
and more special cases were added to try to make various commands work
properly, and as a result the consistency and correctness of the core
functionality have suffered. As a result, the `ivy-read` API has
around 20 arguments and a heap of special cases for particular values
(which are completely undocumented). Numerous functions in Ivy,
[Counsel](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#counsel), and Swiper have
special cases hardcoded into them to detect when they're being called
from specific other functions *in the other two packages*. As a result
of all this, Ivy is incredibly flaky and full of edge-case bugs like
[this one](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/issues/1632). It is these
bugs and quirks in UX that led me to develop Selectrum.

Fundamentally, selecting an item from a list *is not a complicated
problem*, and it *does not require a complicated solution*. That's why
Selectrum is around 1,000 lines of code even though Ivy+Counsel (which
do basically the same thing) are around 11,000 lines together.
Selectrum achieves its conciseness by:

* working with the existing Emacs APIs for completion, rather than
  replacing all of them and then reimplementing every Emacs command
  that uses them (incidentally, this also reduces the number of bugs
  and inconsistencies)
* preferring simplicity and consistency over the "best" possible UX
  for each individual command (which also makes it easier to
  understand what Selectrum is doing and work around the sharp
  corners)
* designing the best possible interface for candidate selection from
  the ground up, rather than repurposing an API that was used for
  something else and then just sticking new things onto it every time
  a bug appears

Selectrum does not support features which break the `completing-read`
API and works with *every* Emacs command with approximately no special
cases, specifically because it focuses on doing the common case as
well as possible.

As a final note, when you're using `selectrum-prescient.el`, there's
an easy way to simulate Ivy's alternate actions. Suppose you've typed
`M-x` and found the command you want, but now you realize you want to
look up the documentation instead. Press `TAB` to insert the
candidate, which has the side effect of placing it at the top of the
recency table in `prescient.el`. Then `C-g` out of Selectrum and type
`C-h f`. The same command will automatically be at the top of the
list, so you can get the documentation just by pressing `RET`. I
believe that this sort of idea can be extended to get all of the
utility out of these extra features without actually implementing
explicit support for them (with all of the attendant complexity and
bugs).

### Why not Icomplete?

[Icomplete](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Icomplete.html)
is another built-in Emacs package for interactive selection. It is
basically the same as the standard `completing-read` framework, except
that the available candidates are displayed in the minibuffer as you
type. Unlike Selectrum, the candidates are displayed horizontally (by
default). This can be changed by some manual configuration, including
customizing `icomplete-separator`, although it is clear that this use
case is not an intended one for Icomplete. A serious usability problem
of Icomplete is that the way you select a candidate from lower down in
the list is very unintuitive: you must "rotate" the entire set of
candidates, whereupon the previous candidates become invisible since
they have wrapped to the bottom of the list.

With sufficient configuration, it is likely possible to replicate a
subset of the features of Selectrum using Icomplete. However, the
documentation of Icomplete is basically nonexistent, and to achieve
this configuration one must bend Icomplete rather severely away from
the interaction model it is designed for. In other words, the
configuration is not an enjoyable process, and the results will never
be equivalent in user experience to a package that was designed for
the desired interaction model in the first place. Selectrum, on the
other hand, offers a well-tuned and snappy vertical completion
interface that is robust and works out of the box.

There is a package which takes care of some of the manual labor of
configuring Icomplete, called
[`icomplete-vertical`](https://github.com/oantolin/icomplete-vertical).

It is worth noting the new [Fido
mode](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/commit/213643a890913f10bac710ca8537e8b1125941d6)
which will be included in Emacs 27. It is basically a variation of
Icomplete that behaves more like Ido. As such, Fido mode does not
offer solutions to the problems outlined in the above sections.

To be transparent, there are a few standard Emacs features which are
not implemented in Selectrum (mostly because I was unaware they
existed) but which do work in Icomplete: for example, many of the
`completion-*` user options such as `completion-ignore-case`. I do not
see any design reason these features cannot all be incorporated into
Selectrum eventually.

### Why not Icicles?

[Because it's maintained on EmacsWiki, enough
said.](https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/5008)

### Why not Snails?

[Snails](https://github.com/manateelazycat/snails) describes itself as
a "modern, easy-to-expand fuzzy-search framework". From the README, it
seems to provide a similar vertical completion interface to Selectrum.
Unfortunately, the package seems to be essentially nonfunctional. I
had to fix three bugs in the code before I could even get candidates
to show up, and filtering and sorting still did not work.

A deeper problem with Snails is that, like Ivy, it goes the route of
wrapping every possible command with a "backend" rather than using
existing Emacs interfaces to handle all possible commands. It's also
worth noting that Snails is unusable by design in a tty environment.

### Why not Sallet?

[Sallet](https://github.com/Fuco1/sallet) describes itself as "a type
of light spherical helmet", according to the repo description.
However, it also appears to be another vertical completion interface.
Although I haven't used Sallet extensively, here are some differences
that I can note:

* Sallet seems to go the route of providing wrappers for all the
  possible commands, rather than implementing all of them via the
  existing `completing-read` interface. I am skeptical of this for the
  reasons outlined in the Ivy section.
* Sallet provides a "rich-text" approach to vertical completion, where
  you are shown an entire buffer with colors and multiple columns.
  Personally, I would prefer something more minimal that fits neatly
  into the minibuffer.
* There is no user-facing documentation, which suggests to me that the
  package is unfinished.

### Why not Raven?

[Raven](https://github.com/chameco/raven) is a little-known package
for vertical completion. It looks quite similar to Selectrum, and
seems pretty usable to me. The main difference is that Selectrum
simply has a more fully-rounded set of features (such as candidate
highlighting and a full `find-file` replacement). I suspect that these
features have simply not yet been implemented.

### What about Swiper?

As discussed in the section on Ivy,
[Swiper](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#swiper) is a buffer-search
package that uses Ivy's interface. The implementation is not
well-abstracted at all, and therefore these two packages are a huge
mess both internally and in usage.

Does Selectrum attempt to provide a replacement for Swiper in addition
to Ivy and Counsel? The answer is no. Rather than blindly porting
functionality from the predecessors of Selectrum, I decided to design
a better buffer-search interface from scratch. During the design
process, I realized that a Selectrum-like interface is not the best
way to present buffer search. Instead, I decided on an improved
variant of the Isearch interface that takes inspiration from the
standard text search interface found in almost every other modern
piece of software, such as web browsers. The result is
[CTRLF](https://github.com/raxod502/ctrlf).
